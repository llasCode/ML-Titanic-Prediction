## ML-Titanic-Prediction

Machine learning project that studies the probability of survival of a passenger on the Titanic. The project has two parts: <br />
1.  Model Training: We use and compare the performance of four classification machine learning models, perceptron, logistic regression, decision trees and random forest. <br />
2.  Feature importance: In the second part, we analyze the importance of each feature for each of the models, to know which features are the most significant in order to accurately predict.
