## ML-Titanic-Prediction

Machine learning project that studies the probability of survival of a passenger on the Titanic. <br />
In the first part of the project, we use and compare the performance of four classification machine learning models, perceptron, logistic regression, decision trees and random forest. <br />
In the second part, a feature importance analysis is done. We analyze the importance of each feature for each of the models, to know which features are the most significant in order to accurately predict.
